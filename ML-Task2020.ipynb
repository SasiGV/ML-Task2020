    "\n",
    "Methods of computing square roots are numerical analysis algorithms for finding the principal, or non-negative, square root (usually denoted √S, 2√S, or S1/2) of a real number. Arithmetically, it means given S, a procedure for finding a number which when multiplied by itself, yields S; algebraically, it means a procedure for finding the non-negative root of the equation x2 - S = 0; geometrically, it means given the area of a square, a procedure for constructing a side of the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every real number has two square roots.In addition to the principal square root, there is a negative square root equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the principal square root, except for zero, which has double square roots of zero. The principal square root of most numbers is an irrational number with an infinite decimal expansion. As a result, the decimal expansion of any such square root can only be computed to some finite-precision approximation. However, even if we are taking the square root of a perfect square integer, so that the result does have an exact finite representation, the procedure used to compute it may only return a series of increasingly accurate approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common analytical methods are iterative and consist of two steps: finding a suitable starting value, followed by iterative refinement until some termination criteria is met. The starting value can be any number, but fewer iterations will be required the closer it is to the final result. The most familiar such method, most suited for programmatic calculation, is Newton's method, which is based on a property of the derivative in the calculus. "

    "##### When to use the sample or population standard deviation\n",
    "Population standard deviation (1) are often used when all the values refers to the entire population interested in and sample standard deviation (2) are used when values refers to the sample. Sometimes confusion can often occur to find which standard deviation to use for above cases, but it depends on what outcome is expected at the end result. Refer below example to understand the different standard deviation cases. [3.2]\n",
    "Example: To measure existing consumer opinion on a product/service, use population standard deviation to provide more quantifiable reliable number. Nevertheless in case of new experiment to attract new consumer, then sample standard deviation is a best choice, because sample result can be categorized based on gender, age and locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Microsoft Excel STDEV.P function\n",
    "To calculate the standard deviation for an entire population data, Microsoft excel provides STDEV.P function. The results are accurate because all data are available. Also in some cases of sample data, and only want standard deviation for the sample, without generalising for the entire population, even in those cases STDEV.P function can be used [3.4]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Microsoft Excel STDEV.S function\n",
    "To calculate the standard deviation for a sample data, STDEV.S function can be used. The results are estimates and therefore not as accurate. The STDEV.S function uses Bessel’s corrections to work on sample data to provide better estimates of the standard deviation. Here the Bessel’s corrections appears in the formula as n-1, where n is the count [3.4].\n",
